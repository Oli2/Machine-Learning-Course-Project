# Machine-Learning-Course-Project
This gh-pages branch has been created to enable peer-reviewers rendering the files on github rather than downloading them to their local machines.
Unfortunately, Predicting_Quality_of_Weigth_Lifting_Exercises_using_ML_algorithmsv2.html file exeeds github's limit
of file size to display the content. 
I will appreciate your effort if you simply download the folder and review the files on your local machine.
Thanks
